# Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis
This project, is a section of my final datascience bootcamp project where I built a model to forecast the future prices of Bitcoin.

Information, particularly from mainstream media, twitter, and particular people like Elon Musk have been known to affect the price of crypto currency.

The goal therefore for this particular project is to analyze bitcoin tweets, check it effect on the price and possibly use the sentiment analysis to make forecasts.

### Workflow:
1. Collect Tweets using the Twitter API and tweepy 
2. Run sentiment analysis on the tweets

### Files:
1. [0_Tweets_full.ipynb](https://github.com/pbamoo/Tweets_Sentiment_Analysis/blob/main/0_Tweets_full.ipynb): Contains one method for streaming tweets as well as the sentiments analysis.
2. [1_get_tweets.ipynb](https://github.com/pbamoo/Tweets_Sentiment_Analysis/blob/main/1_get_tweets.ipynb): is the file containing the other method for getting and saving tweets and [2_BTC_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/pbamoo/Tweets_Sentiment_Analysis/blob/main/2_BTC_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) is the sentiment analysis.
